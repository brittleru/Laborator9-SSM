# Laborator9-SSM
This is the ninth laboratory at Software for Mechatronics Systems, coordinated by Conf. Dr. Ing. Ciprian Ion Rizescu.

#### Brief
The task was to implement a graphical interface in `MATLAB` using `GUIDE`. The GUI must contain the logo of the faculty and of the university, it should have two buttons, one that when pressed will display the centric connecting rod-crank mechanism and the second to display the eccentric connecting rod-crank mechanism. The interface will also have an exit button from the application. </br></br>
Because Iâ€™m special, I also wanted to implement this in `JavaScript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

## Conclusion for the Matlab app
To add the images I used `Axes`, with `CreateFcn` and I added in that function the method `imshow()` with the path of the image. I used a `Panel` for the buttons, their functionality was written in the function `callback()` and their design was done with a property inspector. The title, name, group and date were added with `Static Text`, the design was done with property inspector.
